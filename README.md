# CSCI_201-HelperFile
Homework takes too long and is really tedious. So I turned them into programs. Enjoy

# Working files:
  1. BoothAlgorithim.py
  2. Any of the IEEE to Decimal files
  
# STATUS

  1. The Convert Decimal to IEEE is a bit finnicky when it comes to converting negative floats to IEEE format. Updates are being made.
  2. The IEEE to Decimal should be working correctly and without any issues. 
  3. The BoothAlgorithim performs both signed and unsigned non-optimized Booth mutiplication and signed and unsigned Non-Optimized Regular multiplication

this repository is only staying public as a way to help others who might have to endure this tedious and annoying class
